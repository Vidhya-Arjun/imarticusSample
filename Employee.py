# Employee Management:
# Create a base class Employee with attributes like name , salary and a method calculate_salary().
# Inherit from this class to create subclasses RegularEmployee, ContractEmployee, and Manager.
# Each subclass should have specific attributes and calculations for salary.
# Implement inheritance and polymorphism to calculate the salary of different employee
# types based on their specific
# attributes and rules
